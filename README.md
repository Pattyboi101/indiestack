# IndieStack

Your AI agent searches 8,000+ developer tools before writing code from scratch. 10,000+ installs.

> **Context-efficient AI coding:** One `find_tools()` call finds a 3-line install command instead of generating hundreds of lines of boilerplate. Less code generated = less context consumed.

```bash
claude mcp add indiestack -- uvx --from indiestack indiestack-mcp
```

Then ask your agent:
- "Find an auth solution for my Next.js app"
- "What's the lightest open-source payments library?"
- "Show me migration paths away from Webpack"

---

## What it does

Before your AI writes auth, payments, or email boilerplate — IndieStack searches 8,000+ curated developer tools with real compatibility data from 4,500+ repos. You get install commands, health scores, and what tools actually work together in production.

"Indie" is the curation filter: independent developers and small teams. Focused, lean, maintained, honest pricing.

## Install

**Claude Code** (zero install — runs via uvx):
```bash
claude mcp add indiestack -- uvx --from indiestack indiestack-mcp
```

**Cursor / Windsurf** — add to your MCP config:
```json
{"command": "uvx", "args": ["--from", "indiestack", "indiestack-mcp"]}
```

**Persistent install:**
```bash
pipx install indiestack
claude mcp add indiestack -- indiestack-mcp
```

**CLI (terminal use):**
```bash
pip install indiestack

indiestack search "analytics"
indiestack details simple-analytics
indiestack stack "auth, payments, email"
```
