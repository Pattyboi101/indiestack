# Skill Chains

Common multi-step workflows. Execute sequentially, loading each skill JIT.
Mask previous skill's output when entering the next phase.

## Build a New Feature
1. `brainstorming` → design approval
2. `writing-plans` → implementation steps
3. `test-driven-development` → red-green-refactor per step
4. `verification-before-completion` → confirm everything passes
5. `requesting-code-review` → peer review before merge
6. `finishing-a-development-branch` → merge/PR/cleanup

## Fix a Bug
1. `systematic-debugging` → root cause analysis
2. `test-driven-development` → regression test + fix
3. `verification-before-completion` → confirm fix holds

## Ship / Deploy
1. `verification-before-completion` → all tests pass, no regressions
2. `finishing-a-development-branch` → merge or PR

## Polish a Page
1. `critique` → identify what needs improvement
2. `frontend-design` → implement improvements
3. `polish` → final detail pass

## Major Refactor
1. `brainstorming` → scope and approach
2. `using-git-worktrees` → isolated workspace
3. `writing-plans` → step-by-step plan
4. `test-driven-development` → refactor with test safety net
5. `requesting-code-review` → review before merge
