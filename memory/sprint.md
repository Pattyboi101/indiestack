# Sprint — Current

Last updated: 2026-04-05

## Status: Active

## Completed This Session (2026-04-05)

### Search Quality
- Verified all required `_CAT_SYNONYMS` mappings are present:
  - `state` → `frontend` (covers "state management")
  - `bundler` → `frontend` (covers "bundler" queries)
  - `realtime` → `api` (covers realtime/websocket tools)
  - `vector` → `database` (covers "vector database" queries)
  - `rate` → `api` (covers "rate limiting" queries)
- Previously added: htmx, alpine, preact, lit, solidjs, stencil, ember, trpc, grpc mappings

### Catalog Maintenance
- `scripts/add_missing_tools.py` — script to insert 10 high-priority tools (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Zustand, Jotai, Webpack, esbuild, Upstash, Resend). Checks slug before inserting. Safe to re-run.
- `scripts/backfill_sdk_packages.py` — backfill SDK/install metadata for well-known tools
- `scripts/recategorise_dry_run.py` — dry-run analysis of developer-tools category (2,931 tools)

### Orchestra Briefings Updated (2026-04-05)
- Backend: developer-tools category cleanup
- Frontend: SEO/copy improvements for new category pages
- MCP: (check `.orchestra/departments/mcp/briefing.md`)
- Content: (check `.orchestra/departments/content/briefing.md`)

## Current Priorities
1. Run `scripts/add_missing_tools.py` on production → rebuild FTS
2. Backend: recategorise misplaced tools out of developer-tools (2,931 → target ~1,500)
3. Frontend: verify new category pages (frontend-frameworks, caching, mcp-servers)
4. MCP server: check if any new synonyms need PyPI publish

## Known Blockers
- None currently

## Decisions
- Keep MCP server fully anonymous — no API key gating (see gotchas.md)
- Maker Pro price: $19/mo (canonical source: stripe.md)
- `_LIKE_STOP_WORDS` pattern used for FTS to avoid multi-word false matches
