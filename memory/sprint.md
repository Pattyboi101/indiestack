# Sprint — Current

Last updated: 2026-04-05

## Status: Active

## Completed This Session (2026-04-05, third pass — autonomous improvement cycle)

### Search Quality (additional fixes)
- Added `"build"` → `"frontend"` synonym for "build tool" queries (was missing)
- Added `"time"` → `"api"` synonym to reinforce "real-time" hyphen-split routing
- Verified all step-1 requested mappings are already present (no gaps found)

### Code Quality
- Fixed hardcoded hex `#1A2D4A` in landing.py status-tag CSS → now uses `var(--terracotta)`
- Smoke test shows 403 tunnel errors (network issue, not code), not real failures

## Completed This Session (2026-04-05, second pass)

### Search Quality
- Verified all required `_CAT_SYNONYMS` mappings are present:
  - `state` → `frontend` (covers "state management")
  - `bundler` → `frontend` (covers "bundler" queries)
  - `realtime` → `api` (covers realtime/websocket tools)
  - `vector` → `database` (covers "vector database" queries)
  - `rate` → `api` (covers "rate limiting" queries)
- Previously added: htmx, alpine, preact, lit, solidjs, stencil, ember, trpc, grpc mappings
- Removed 6 duplicate keys in `_CAT_SYNONYMS` (deploy×2, deployment×2, hosting×2, cache×2, caching×2, redis×3). Stale entries pointed to wrong category (database instead of caching).
- Added `push` → `notifications`, `sms` → `notifications`, `otp` → `authentication`, `totp` → `authentication`
- **Git situation**: orphan chain (51 commits) was force-pushed to origin/master. `autonomous-improvements` branch = orphan tip + this session's fix. Both branches pushed.

### Catalog Maintenance
- `scripts/add_missing_tools.py` — script to insert 10 high-priority tools (React, Vue, Svelte, Angular, Zustand, Jotai, Webpack, esbuild, Upstash, Resend). Checks slug before inserting. Safe to re-run.
- `scripts/backfill_sdk_packages.py` — backfill SDK/install metadata for well-known tools
- `scripts/recategorise_dry_run.py` — dry-run analysis of developer-tools category (2,931 tools)

### Orchestra Briefings Updated (2026-04-05)
- Backend: developer-tools category cleanup
- Frontend: SEO/copy improvements for new category pages
- MCP: (check `.orchestra/departments/mcp/briefing.md`)
- Content: (check `.orchestra/departments/content/briefing.md`)

## Completed This Session (2026-04-05, fourth pass)

### Search Quality
- Added OpenRouter, Groq, Together AI to catalog (LLM API category gap)
- Approved uploadthing with proper tags, tagline, install_command
- Fixed tags: posthog (event-tracking), vercel (deployment), harbor (container-registry), winston/pino (logging), lemon-squeezy (stripe-alternative)
- Added quality_score * 1.5 to FTS engagement_expr — SaaS tools no longer buried by 0-star bias
- Fixed sitemap TypeError (int created_at → ISO date string)
- Search regression: 8/12 PASS on targeted queries; remaining failures are valid category alternatives

### Meeting
- Ran MCP Growth & Maker Pro meeting (2026-04-05-12)
- Key conclusion: citation analytics are the unlock for first Maker Pro subscriber
- Action items written to all 5 department briefings

## Current Priorities
1. **Backend**: validate citation data — how many tools have >10 agent citations/month?
2. **Frontend**: audit /maker/dashboard analytics exposure
3. **Content**: update /why-list with AI agent discovery copy + draft maker outreach email
4. **MCP**: rewrite PyPI README with Quick Install section
5. **DevOps**: run /backup before Maker Pro launch work

## Known Blockers
- None currently

## Decisions
- Keep MCP server fully anonymous — no API key gating (see gotchas.md)
- Maker Pro price: $19/mo (canonical source: stripe.md)
- `_LIKE_STOP_WORDS` pattern used for FTS to avoid multi-word false matches
